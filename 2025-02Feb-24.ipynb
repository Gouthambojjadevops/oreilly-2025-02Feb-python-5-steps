    "- Python's nouns are values\n",
    "- We can assign any value to a variable (a name that lets us keep track of it)\n",
    "- Every value has a type\n",
    "    - Integers\n",
    "    - Floats\n",
    "    - Strings\n",
    "    - Lists\n",
    "    - Tuples\n",
    "- Each data structure is useful for different things\n",
    "    - Faster/slower at retrieval and storage\n",
    "    - Can we modify it? (Is it mutable?)\n",
    "    - What can we store in it?\n",
    "\n",
    "The default data structure we use for storing (and retrieving) is the *list*:\n",
    "- Can store anything at all (although it's traditional for all values to be of the same type)\n",
    "- Items are stored and retrieved via a numeric index, starting at 0\n",
    "- We can modify a list (i.e., it is *mutable*):\n",
    "    - We can update/change an existing value by assigning to that index\n",
    "    - We can add one or more new items to a list, typically at the end, using some methods, including `list.append`\n",
    "    - We can remove one or more items from a list, typically from the end, using some methods, including `list.pop`\n",
    "- You can iterate over the elements of a list, one at a time\n",
    "- What's wrong with lists?\n",
    "    - Because we can modify them, they always have some extra space around in memory, so that the computer doesn't need to allocate new memory each time we do sometime\n",
    "    - If we want to search for a value in a list, we need to iterate over it, one element at a time (this can be slow, if we have a big list)\n",
    "\n",
    "(Both lists and tuples are ordered -- whatever order you create values, the elements will remain in that order.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem is solved, to some degree, by *tuples*.\n",
    "- Tuples are like lists, but they are *immutable*, they cannot be changed\n",
    "- As a result, they have no extra memory -- they are as compact and efficient as something can be in Python\n",
    "- As a result, tuples are often used in Python to represent a collection of data\n",
    "    - A person, who has a name, birthdate, and height -- three different types of values, appropriate for a tuple\n",
    "    - A database record, which has several fields of different types\n",
