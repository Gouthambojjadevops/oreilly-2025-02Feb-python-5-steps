    "\n",
    "Back in the early days of computers, if you had a problem to solve, you created a computer to solve it. If you had another problem to solve, you created a new, separate computer to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty soon, it became clear that we should have a general-purpose computer that we can reconfigure and change to solve many different problems. The way that we would tell this computer what to do was with binary digits (bits), 1s and 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news? This worked!\n",
    "\n",
    "The bad news? It was very hard to write programs in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty soon after that, people created *programming languages*. The idea is that we write our instructions in something that looks like English, but is translated into 1s and 0s for the computer's benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is one of hundreds of thousands of different programming languages. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is not very fast to execute, relative to other languages\n",
    "- But Python is *very* fast to write, read (understand), and debug/maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a great language for an age in which computers are cheap and people are expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- C is a very fast-to-execute language, but very complex and hard for most people, because it is \"low level,\" working much like the computer things/acts.\n",
    "- Java is higher level than C and also executes quickly, but still requires you keep track of more things than Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "The O'Reilly site has some videos I made telling you how to install Python and get VSCode working.\n",
